<b>#Intro:</b><br>
My name is Filopoulou Dionysia and I have graduated from the Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics in 2017. <br>
The last three years I work as a frontend developer in a company which is located in Patras called eight8.<br>
I think this master will give me the opportunity to evolve and broaden my mind.<br>
Specifically the course "Information Visualization" will help me to learn best practices on github via projects.
